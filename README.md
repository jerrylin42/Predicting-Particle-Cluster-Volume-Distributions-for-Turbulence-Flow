# Predicting-Particle-Cluster-Volume-Distributions-for-Turbulence-Flow
Understanding mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of particle cluster volume distributions using observed data.


# Project Outline
The dataset consists of n = 89 simulations, each conducted at a different set of input
parameters. There are three parameters (predictors): Reynolds number Re, gravitational
acceleration Fr, and particle characteristic St. 
The raw response variable (obtained from numerical simulation and
cluster analysis) is a probability distribution for particle cluster volumes. Since probability
distributions are hard to work with, collaborators instead summarized these distributions
by their first four raw moments.

We want to explore how fluid turbulence (quantified by 
Reynolds number or Re), gravitational acceleration (quantified by Froud
number or F r) and particlesâ€™ characteristics (e.g. size, density which is
quantified by Stokes number or St) affect the spatial distribution and
clustering of particles in an idealized turbulence (homogeneous isotropic
turbulence or HIT).
