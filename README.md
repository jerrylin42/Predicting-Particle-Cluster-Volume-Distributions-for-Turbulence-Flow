# Particle Clustering in Turbulent Flows

## Project Overview

This project investigates how fluid turbulence and particle characteristics affect the spatial distribution and clustering of particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT). The analysis is based on **n = 89** numerical simulations, each conducted with different input parameters.

### Dataset Structure

**Predictors (Input Parameters):** - **Reynolds number (Re):** Quantifies fluid turbulence intensity - **Froude number (Fr):** Quantifies inertial to gravitational acceleration effects - **Stokes number (St):** Quantifies particle characteristics (size, density) and measures particle interaction with stream.

**Response Variables:** Raw simulation output consists of probability distributions for particle cluster volumes. These distributions are summarized using their first four raw moments: - Mean - Variance - Skewness - Kurtosis
