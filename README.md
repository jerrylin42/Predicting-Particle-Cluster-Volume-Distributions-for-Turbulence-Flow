# Predicting-Particle-Cluster-Distributions-for-Turbulence-Flow
Understanding mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of particle cluster volume distributions using observed data.


# Project Outline
The dataset consists of n = 89 simulations, each conducted at a different set of input
parameters. There are three parameters (predictors): Reynolds number Re, gravitational
acceleration Fr, and particle characteristic St. 
The raw response variable (obtained from numerical simulation and
cluster analysis) is a probability distribution for particle cluster volumes. Since probability
distributions are hard to work with, collaborators instead summarized these distributions
by their first four raw moments.
