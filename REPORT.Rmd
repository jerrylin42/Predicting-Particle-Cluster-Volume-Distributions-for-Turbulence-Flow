#DELETE LATER

-   understand data, what to do with "inf"

-   calculate 4 new cols, one for each metric we predict (mean, sd, skew, kurt)

-   for each of the 4 categories (but apply same method across alll 4): MUST DECIDE METHOD: which model do we start with (full interactions?)? How do we evaluate the best model selection methods (BIC/AIC, ANOVA, CV, subset/fwd/bwd selection....)? How do we select what type of model to use (OLS, ridge, lasso)? ———hardest part (bc code should be straightforward)

-   run models through testing data

-   finalize all 4 models, and interpret coefficients (results) -\>provide insights into broader research question in conclusion
